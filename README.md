# PlayMeIn is an application that allows users to create their very own theme song. Once a user navigates to the website, they can select a genre from which their song will be generated. Once a genre is choosen and the create button is selected, the application pulls six random voice files and blends them together, creating a unique theme song for the user. The user can then export the song to their device and use as they wish.
